# **5 Assumptions:** 
- Linearity 
- No endogeneity 
- Normality and homosecedasiticity of Errors
- No Auto-Correlation
- No Multicolinearity

**Mistake:** 
Perform Regression which voilates one of these Ausmptions

## **1.  Linearity**<br>
Each Predictor should have linear relationship with the response variable. <br>

**How to Check?**<br> 
We can scatter plot plot each predictor against the response to check the Linear Strucure

**Response Vs Pridector**
- Partial Regression Plot
- Partial Residual Plot<br>
